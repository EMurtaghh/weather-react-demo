# This is an example demo

This repo uses React & React-Bootstrap (with API data from openweathermap.com) to create a functional and informative Weather Tracking App for a given city.

This demo currently supports basic weather readout display (weather condition, temp, humidity) for 3 hour interval over the course of 12 hours (from first display marking).
